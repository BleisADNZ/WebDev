This website started with a mixture of multiple templates and website examples, however the final version contains pieces of intriccate code that I thought I would never deal with.

Important features added
- Animated image displayer - A piece of work done by me by creating a <div> tag and making it unscrollable to force and javascript script animate it to scroll automatically depending on specific timers.
- Animated roadmap slider - the roadmap animation is a basic one, however I was tasked to make the website animated to show the middle line move along the website, this is done by having a script running a fucntion when the user scrolls in the page, then check whether the roadmap is on screen and if it is the <div> acting as the middle line grows by adding the height of the user scroll, and also backwards so the line animates up and down depending on where the user is looking at.
- Web3.js - This was what I was hired for, a web3.js implementation to handle contract functions, in this case it was from connecting a wallet and displaying the total amount minted on the contract with a percentage, and a button to run "mint()" on the contract by customizing the amount the user needs to input to make the function run perfectly, in this case it was adding value to the function to make the contract sell the mints by sending the payed amount to the contract address.
